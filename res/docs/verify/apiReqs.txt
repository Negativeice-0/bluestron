# using reqs

That’s a big win! Seeing that `200 OK` for `/api/testimonials` (even if it's an empty `[]`) means your JPA mapping is finally aligned with the database. You're right: empty tables are fine; the crash only happens when Java expects a specific column that the database can't provide.

To confirm your backend is ready for the frontend requirements outlined in the Bluestron document, you need to verify that your API supports the **three main pillars** of the business.

## 1. Verification Checklist (Backend vs. Requirements)

Based on the PDF, here is what your API needs to provide for the frontend to work:

| Requirement | Backend Status | Verification Step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <br>**Course Categories**

 | **Confirmed** | Your `/api/categories` returns the 5 main categories (PM, Data, GIS, etc.).

 |
| <br>**Course List** 

 | **Confirmed** | <br>`/api/courses` returns the courses, including `isFeatured` for the home page carousel.

 |
| <br>**Registration** 

 | **Unknown** | Do you have a `POST /api/registrations` endpoint that accepts Name, Email, Organization, and Role? 

 |
| <br>**Other Services** 

 | **Missing?** | The doc requires sections for Research, Data Analysis, and Software Dev. Do you have endpoints for these?

 |
| <br>**Blog/Insights** 

 | **Confirmed** | <br>`/api/blog` exists, but needs a `POST` method for the CMS to add articles.

 |

### 2. Testing the "CMS" Capability

The document specifies a **CMS backend** so you can update courses and manage registrations. To "build the frontend" confidently, you should test if you can actually add data.

**Try this test `POST` for the Blog (since it's currently empty):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/blog \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title": "The Future of M&E", "content": "Modern trends in data...", "author": "Admin"}'

```

*Note: This uses the `AdminController` we discussed earlier.*

### 3. Frontend Architecture Strategy

Since Bluestron wants a **Modern UX** and **Responsive Design**, here is how you should map your React/Vue/Angular components to your current API:

* 
**Home Component:** Calls `/api/courses` (filters for `isFeatured: true`) and `/api/testimonials`.


* 
**Course Catalog:** Calls `/api/categories` for the sidebar and `/api/courses` for the main grid.


* 
**Registration Modal:** Needs to send a `POST` to your registration endpoint when the "Register Now" button is clicked.



### Next Steps

Before you start the frontend code:

 
>**Does your `Registration` entity have all the fields** from Page 8 of the PDF (Phone, Organization, Role, Payment Option)? 

>**Would you like me to help you create a `ServiceController**` to handle the Research and Software Development descriptions so they aren't hardcoded in the frontend?
