moving forward rember that i said we shloud use tailwind defaults (so ignore all your configs - cretae next app provied me with them and more except next.config.ts i left it empty) i replaced them with <>. No docker or flyaway or jenkins, I want it as minimum complexity as possible i can learn and  use automations later and we ar using tailwind v4 not v3. I also noticed you completely ignored bluestron requirements (no featured courses carousel ), my requirements (img src instead or next/image), and how do you plan on implementing full admin functionlaity as per the guide.
