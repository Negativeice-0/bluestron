Everything should be in springboot 3*, nextjs lates (with best practices for nextjs and typescript), 

the backend is postgres with schema definitions (must have if not exixts) in database with commands to run them in make file. 

The goal is to build an enterprise firendly production ready, minimum dependancy system. 

I need you to give me the prompt that would allow me to easily and quicly build the app from scratch focusing on dependent blocks at a time 

(i.e categories requires courses so they shall be built fully (seeded db + java + ui) 

with verifications like curl to ensure they work perfectly. 

I need the full codes, full paths and alegorical brief comments to summarize how the codes work. Do you have any questions?
