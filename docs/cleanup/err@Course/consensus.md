copilot is vibrational, literally took my thoughts out of my head, the clarification was insane and gemini is still producing content as if i need brevity.

SAme initialization in all three but only deepseek and copilot actually asked questions, though i put deepseek on deepthink so it actually stood a chance.

Ultimately, copilot wins, it just remembers everything better, but deep seek can still chug out documentation more than both gemini and copilot.

I'll use it for corrections.
