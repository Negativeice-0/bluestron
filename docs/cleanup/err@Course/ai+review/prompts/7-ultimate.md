Uploaded bluestron business guide pdf.

What you just gave above is exactly what i expected from the start tweak the below prompt so that after setup, module one hanldes categories end to end with verification and we can then stress test with springboot or bean factories to simulate or seed 100 users registering, visiting and consuming the course content (videos,text,etc). <You're giving feedback on a new version of ChatGPT.

Good — now we can close the loop properly.

I will do three things, in order, and I will be explicit about scope so expectations are aligned:

Confirm whether the last two prompts are sufficient (short answer: yes, with one mandatory ordering wrapper).

Give you a canonical end-to-end workflow for building Bluestron from the attached PDF, step by step, using those prompts.

Show how the entire PDF resolves into one singular architecture, so homepage, courses, admin, services, CMS, etc. do not fight each other.

Provide a “live template blueprint” (folders + modules + execution order) that proves the system works without dumping thousands of lines of code in one go.

I will not hallucinate missing requirements; everything is grounded in the PDF you provided

.

1. Are the last two prompts sufficient?
✅ Yes — with one clarification

You need exactly these:

MASTER CONTROL PROMPT
(Deterministic Build Contract + 7 Laws + execution order)

CANONICAL README / CHECKLIST
(The constitution + validation mechanism)

PLUS one small but critical wrapper that fixes ordering:

You must follow the Bluetsron Canonical Module Order:
Module 0 → Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3 → Module 4.
You must not jump ahead to UI or pages.


That is it.
No third “clever” prompt is required.

2. The Canonical Bluestron Build Workflow

(Mapped directly to the PDF)

This is the workflow you asked for — what to build, in what order, and why, using the prompts.

PHASE 0 — INTERPRET THE PDF INTO DOMAINS (ONCE)

From the PDF 

5.Bluestron Training Business

, Bluestron is not “a website”. It is:

A Training business (primary)

Plus 3 secondary service businesses:

Research

Data Analysis & Management

Software Development

This immediately yields four bounded contexts:

training
research
data_analysis
software_development


Everything else (homepage, blog, contact) is projection, not domain.

3. MODULE-BY-MODULE WORKFLOW (THE HEART OF THE ANSWER)
🔹 MODULE 0 — SYSTEM SKELETON (FOUNDATION)

Purpose
Create the invariant architecture all other modules must obey.

What gets built

Backend project (Spring Boot 3.5.9, Java 21)

Frontend project (Next.js App Router)

Shared migration engine (empty but wired)

Empty admin capability (no entities yet)

Stub homepage (no content logic)

Why first

Prevents AIs from inventing structure later

Ensures admin is foundational, not bolted on

Prompt usage

MASTER CONTROL PROMPT

README

Task: “Generate Module 0 only”

🔹 MODULE 1 — CORE DOMAIN (TRUTH LAYER)

This is where the PDF becomes data, not pages.

From the PDF 

5.Bluestron Training Business

:

Training domain must include:

CourseCategory

Course

CourseInstance (dates, venue, mode)

Registration

Other service domains include:

ServiceOffering

ServiceEnquiry

Key rule

No homepage.
No filters UI.
No pretty pages.

Just entities + services + repositories.

Admin is NOT implemented yet, only domain truth.

🔹 MODULE 2 — ADMIN CAPABILITIES (CMS GUARANTEE)

This directly satisfies the PDF requirement:

“CMS backend so we can update courses, add new services, manage registrations”

Invariant

If it exists in the domain, admin can edit it.

So for every entity:

AdminController

AdminService

Admin frontend pages

This is where:

Courses are created

Categories edited

Dates updated

Registrations viewed

Enquiries managed

At this point, the site is fully manageable even without a homepage.

🔹 MODULE 3 — PUBLIC READ MODE (WEBSITE APPEARS)

Now — and only now — you implement what the PDF visually describes:

Home

About

Courses landing

Category → course → detail

Service pages

Contact

All these pages are read-only projections of domain data.

This satisfies:

Sitemap

UX requirements

CTA buttons

Registration flow (read → submit)

The homepage is derived, not authoritative.

🔹 MODULE 4 — COMPOSITION, FILTERING, SEO

This fulfills:

Filters (category, mode, date)

Search

Clean URLs

Navigation

SEO metadata

Analytics hooks

Still no business logic.

4. How Admin Editing Resolves Everything (Key Insight)

You asked:

“how can i ensure admin can edit everything?”

Because the architecture enforces this flow:

Admin → Domain → Public Pages


Examples:

Admin edits a Course → Course page updates

Admin adds a Category → Appears in filters

Admin disables a Course → Removed from homepage carousel

Admin edits Service description → Service page updates

No page has hard-coded content.

This is why homepage is never first.

5. How the Entire PDF Resolves into One Architecture

Let’s map it cleanly.

PDF Requirement	Where It Lives
Courses & categories	Module 1 (Domain)
CMS backend	Module 2 (Admin)
Homepage hero, carousel	Module 3 (Public)
Filtering/search	Module 4
Registration workflow	Module 1 + 2 + 3
Services pages	Module 1 + 3
SEO, analytics	Module 4
Responsive UI	Frontend cross-cutting

No conflicts.
No duplication.
No guessing.

6. “Live Template” (Working Proof Without Code Dump)

If you cloned the repo after Module 3, you would have:

backend/
  modules/
    training/
    research/
    data_analysis/
    software_development/

frontend/
  modules/
    training/
    research/
    data-analysis/
    software-development/
    admin/


At that point:

Admin can manage all content

Public site renders everything

Registration works

Services are distinct but subordinate to training (as PDF requires)

This is the working live template — extended incrementally, not regenerated.

7. Final, Honest Claim

Most LLMs fail here because they:

Start with homepage

Mix CMS and UI

Treat admin as an afterthought

Collapse domains into pages

What you have now is a manufacturing process, not a chat.

If you want the next concrete step, the only correct one is:

“Generate Module 0 for Bluestron Training Business.”

That is where proof begins.> All as per bluestron pdf guide.
