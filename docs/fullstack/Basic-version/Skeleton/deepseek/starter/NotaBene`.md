I have been working on bluestron from the 23rd full time, only taking three breaks since then (christmas, and two days where I was so burnt out I could not do anything but watch a movie and remind myself i am still human).

I won't ask for forgiveness nor pitty, I merely ask you to look at the requirements, take into account I first started with vanilla web technologies plus php which took 3 weeks.

I learnt a lot and i regret non of it. It was arduos and there were times I almost gave up, but i did not and even now I still seek to level up. Proceed as you see fit, i.e allow us to show you our progress or write us off.
