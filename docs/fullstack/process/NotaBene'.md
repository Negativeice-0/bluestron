It has been a hard and grueling process, starting frsh severally until I finally listened to grok ai assistant and John from IT.

"If you have tried and failed, leave it and pivot!"

This actually saves time and keeps you from going mad.

The part I struggled with the most was quiting when finally something was working, grok practically told me i impemented the simplest part that is why its worked.

Suffice to say I did not linger any longer.
