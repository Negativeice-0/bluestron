Copilot seems to hanlde backend well, for frontend i will have to upload bluestron to gemini.

Then prompt it like so:"i need to match the ui requirements of the attached document.

I need it to be breath taking, with high energy orange, navy blue and softwhite, mobile first and dynamic.

We will start by perfecting the layout, navbar, footer, etc -- those globally inherited (ask for the ones you need but try to maintain content available only filling in missing details.)

Note that they were merely for testing and woked well with the databse hence my insitsance on mainatining prior content.

Include a way to use existing tailwind colors as cutom configs seem to be ignored and there is no point trying to fight this.

Ensure strict typescript requirements are met, nextjs best practices are used like next/image, etc and suggest the best approach for linking to the databse."
