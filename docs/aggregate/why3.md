These three have the most generously free, reasonably powerful coding assistants i have seen.

Chat is okay, but the limits are crazy, claude does not care about poor people, and I can't think of another relatively powerfulone.

Overall alot of refining had to be done, over weeks. From chat to copilot to deepseek and back, iterating to find the perfect prompt -- ai binary.
