This took a good four months stewing in my head,
 but really the learning started much earlier.

The pressure + my insistance
on finding better workflows finally paid off.

Without ai i woudl normally take a few weeks
building a full site, then iterate to new projects
using it as a template and taking code from it into
the new project.

Now, i only tweak the prompt and get virgin code.

The deadline didn't allow me to use my old ways,
not enough time, but since i have been struggling
with how to use ai better with forex and programming
back to back for years with everything else with standing
finally i see the fruits of my labor.

I almost cracked at the point i had a long chat with qwen ai
which lead to the crazy mode.md document in this directory.

Suffice to say i a lot of prompting, code regenration and 
project dumping occured.
