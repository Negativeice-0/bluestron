before we continue, could you use an android app like whatsapp to explain all the above 

i.e getters are like the code behind the ui card displays for whatsapp chats and setters are the code behind the send chat button, 

juxtaposed against all of bluestron requirements so i can explain to them exactly how everyhing works in leimann terms as an executive summary

 with a conlusionary elevator pitch to package it all nicely (especially migrations
 
  -- can admin add schema via admin ui, drop a tabel, etc -- if so how does it all work; i only see schema definitions in the v..inti java classes)
  
  . How does make migrate work exactly, can i use it drop a table then edit that file then run it to create a new table while in development and how does this relate/affect/effect admin ui?
